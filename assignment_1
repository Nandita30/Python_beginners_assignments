Question 1: What are the differences between operators and values in the following?
Operators - In Python, operators are the symbols which are used to perform the arithmetic and logical operations on one or more different variables.
Values - The terms on where these operators perform operations are known as values or operand.
* - Arithmetic Operator
'Hello' - Value
-87.8 - Value
'-' - Operator
'/' - Operator
'+' - Operator
6 – Value
Question 2: What is the difference between string and variable?
String - Strings are the sequence of characters which are enclosed either in single quotes or double quotes.
For e.g. “spam”
Variable – A variables are those where you can store data and can make changes in it.
For e.g. spam
Question 3: Describe 3 different data forms
There are many data forms in python like numeric, string, sequence, binary, mapping, Boolean and sets.
INT – This is the numeric data form which holds only integer type data.
E.g. a = 22
STRING – This is the string data form which holds the sequence of characters.
E.g. b = “nandita”
DICTONARY – This is the mapping data form which holds the data in key: value pairs.
E.g. c = {‘firstname’:’nandita’,’lastname’:’mathur’,’marks’:87}
Question 4: What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
An expression is a combination of a values, variables and operators using different tokens.
C = a + b
‘C’ is an output variable where result of expression is stored.
‘a’ & ‘b’ are the input variables which either we take from user or enter by ourselves.
‘+’ is a token
In python, using print statement the interpreter evaluate the expression and displays the result
Question 5: This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
Expression and a statement?
Expression:  It is a collection of values, variables and operators, which leads to the result
Example:
>> 5*5 (expression)
>>25 (result)
Statement: It represents an action or command to execute by the interpreter and displays the results. Statements are of many types:
•	If Statements
•	If-Else Statements
•	If-elif-else Statements
•	While Statements
Example:
>> i=10
>> if i<=10:
print("this is the correct answer")
this is the correct answer
Question 6: After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1

>>> bacon = 22
>>> bacon + 1
23
Bacon variable contain 23
Question 7: What should the values of the following two terms be?
>>>‘spam’ + ‘spamspam’
>>>‘spamspamspam’ (#output)
>>>‘spam’ * 3
>>> ‘spamspamspam’ (#output)
Question 8: Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Variables are those which assign in names rather in values. Otherwise, it gives you an error “can’t assign to literals”.
For e.g.
>>> egg='nandita
>>> egg
nandita

>>>100=”nanvi”
SyntaxError: can't assign to literal
Question 9: What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
>>> a = int (input ())
3
>>> a
3
>>> b = float (input ())
5
>>> b
5.0
>>> c = str (input ())
nandita
>>> c
'nandita'
Question 10: Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
‘I have eaten’ + 99 + ‘burritos.’ expression cause an error because numbers and strings are not concatenate together, only the strings are concatenate using ‘+’ operator. If we have to concatenate number/value with string then we have to convert it into string with the use of str data form.
>>> 'I have eaten'  +  '  '  +  '99'  +  '  '  + 'burritos.'
'I have eaten 99 burritos.'
