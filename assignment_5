1.	What does an empty dictionary’s code look like?
{}
2.	 What is the value of a dictionary value with the key ’foo’ and the value 42?
42
3.	What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
List – It is a collection of homogeneous data 
Dictionary – It stores the data in a key-value pairs
4.	What happens if you try to access spam[‘foo’] if spam is {‘bar’: 100}?
spam = {'bar':100}
spam['foo'] #it shows error
KeyError                                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-353983a69fca> in <module>
----> 1 spam['foo']
KeyError: 'foo'
5.	If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions ‘cat’ in spam and ‘cat’ in spam.keys()?
spam = {'bar':100,'cat':[1,2,3,4]} #Stored Dictionary
'cat' in spam #Expression
o/p True
Spam.keys() #Keys() function call in spam, shows all the keys present in dictionary ‘spam’ 
o/p dict_keys(['bar', 'cat']
6.	If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions ‘cat’ in spam and ‘cat’ in spam.values()?
spam = {'bar':100,'cat':[1,2,3,4]} #Stored Dictionary
'cat' in spam #Expression
o/p True
spam.values() #Values() function call in spam, shows all the keys respected values present in dictionary ‘spam’
o/p dict_values([100, [1, 2, 3, 4]])
7.	What is a shortcut for the following code?
if ‘color’ not in spam:
spam[‘color’] = ‘black’
Shortcut method to store the key-value pair in dictionary
spam.setdefault (‘color’:’black’)
8.	How do you “pretty print” dictionary values using which module and function?
Import pprint #import module ‘pprint’, this will show the complete display of the items in dictionary
message = ‘a set of words that is complete in itself, typically containing a subject and predicate, conveying a statement, question, exclamation, or command, and consisting of a main clause and sometimes one or more subordinate clauses.’
count = {}
for character in message:
count.setdefault(character, 0)
count[character] = count[character] + 1
pprint.pprint(count)
